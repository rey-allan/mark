# mark_app

An app for controlling and managing M.A.R.K.

## Dependencies

This app requires the [`inputs`](https://github.com/zeth/inputs) library to be installed manually. The reason is that the latest release doesn't include some important fixes present in the repository. To install manually, follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeth/inputs.git
cd inputs
python setup.py install
```
